# Full Stack Open Course Exercises

This repository contains my solutions and projects for the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/) course from the University of Helsinki. It's a comprehensive guide to modern full-stack development using React, Node.js, MongoDB, and more.

## Structure
- **part0/**: Fundamentals of web apps (diagrams, notes).
- **part1/**: Introduction to React (courseinfo, unicafe, anecdotes apps).
- (Additional parts will be added as I progress.)

## Setup and Running
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fullstackopen.git`
2. For each app (e.g., part1/courseinfo):
   - Navigate: `cd part1/courseinfo`
   - Install dependencies: `npm install` (or your package manager)
   - Run dev server: `npm run dev`
   - Open in browser: http://localhost:5173

## Technologies
